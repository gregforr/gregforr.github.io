	“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home.<br>
	 That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know,<br>
	 everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever <br>
	 was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and <br>
	 suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies,<br>
	 and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every <br>
	 hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization,<br>
	 every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every<br>
	 mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, <br>
	 every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every <br>
	 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner <br>
	 in the history of our species lived there — <br>
	 on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.” <br>
			― Carl Sagan  <br>
