	“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home.<br>
	 That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you <br>
	 know, everyone you ever heard of, every human <br>
	 being who ever was, lived out their lives. The <br>
	 aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of <br>
	 confident religions, ideologies, and economic <br>
	 doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero <br>
	 and coward, every creator and destroyer of <br>
	 civilization, every king and peasant, every young <br>
	 couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful <br>
	 child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of <br>
	 morals, every corrupt politician, every <br>
	 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every <br>
	 saint and sinner in the history of our species <br>
	 lived there — <br>
	 on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.” <br>
